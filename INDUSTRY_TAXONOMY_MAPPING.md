## NEW HOMEPAGE TILES (your screenshot — 9 tiles)

| # | Homepage Tile Name | Maps to Live URL | Status |
|---|-------------------|------------------|--------|
| 1 | Water Treatment | `/industries/water-treatment/` | ✅ Exact match |
| 2 | Oil, Gas & Mining | `/industries/oil-and-gas/` | ⚠️ Name expanded, URL stays same |
| 3 | Coatings & Construction | `/industries/coatings-and-construction/` | ✅ Exact match |
| 4 | Personal Care & Cosmetics | `/industries/beauty-and-personal-care/` | ⚠️ Name changed, URL stays same |
| 5 | Industrial Manufacturing | — | 🆕 NEW (no live URL yet) |
| 6 | Agriculture | `/industries/agriculture/` | ✅ Exact match |
| 7 | Textiles | `/industries/textiles/` | ✅ Exact match |
| 8 | Home & Industrial Care | `/home-care-institutional-industrial-cleaning/` | ⚠️ Name shortened, URL stays same |
| 9 | Plastics & Polymers | — | 🆕 NEW (no live URL yet) |

## WHAT HAPPENED TO LUBRICANTS?
Lubricants is LIVE with indexed subpages but is NOT on the new homepage.
**Decision needed:** Keep as a hidden industry (still accessible via direct URL) or merge into Industrial Manufacturing?

## RULES FOR THE PROJECT

1. The 9 homepage tiles are the LOCKED display taxonomy
2. But ALL 8 live URL slugs must continue to work — no 404s
3. New industries (Industrial Manufacturing, Plastics & Polymers) need NEW slugs:
   - Suggested: `/industries/industrial-manufacturing/`
   - Suggested: `/industries/plastics-polymers/`
4. Display names can evolve (e.g., "Oil, Gas & Mining") but URL slugs NEVER change
5. Lubricants URL must remain live regardless of homepage visibility
